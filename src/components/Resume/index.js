      <p>
        I love a challenge. When I'm tasked with a project I'm not 100% sure
        how to complete - I get excited - and then I get to work! I would love
        the opportunity to put that enthusiasm into action for you, and for us
        to end up with something beautiful as a result.
      </p>
