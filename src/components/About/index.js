        <p>
          I love a challenge. When I'm tasked with a project I'm not 100% sure
          how to complete - I get excited - and then I get to work! I would love
          the opportunity to put that enthusiasm into action for you, and for us
          to end up with something beautiful as a result.
        </p>
