        <h4>Hi, I'm Christy Sheppard</h4>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Web Developer utilizing deep experience with Adobe
          Graphic Suite and e-commerce management skills to craft and design
          attractive and intuitive user experiences on the web. I've been in the
          workforce for a long time working in front-end web
          development/management and recently decided I'd like to get to know
          all about how the back-end works, too. When I'm tasked with a project
          I'm not 100% sure how to complete - I get excited - and then I get to
          work!
